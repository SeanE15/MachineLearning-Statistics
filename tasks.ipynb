A common assumption amoungst researchers was that biological data tended towards a Normal Distirbution. Pearson disputed this, noting a significant skewness to certain datasets - which drove him to develop a set of statistical analysis tests which would more accurately find out how well a model fit into an observation - this time taking their skewness into consideration in the final result."

    "The Statistic result is a measurement of how many standard deviations the two samples are apart. In the above test I got a statistic value of 14.72167648.  This highlights that the t-statistic is 14.72 times bigger than what could be expected by 'random chance' - showing that it is highly likely that based off the two samples tested, there is a significant difference between the two. ie. they could not be confused for one another or there is very little (if any) overlap between the two samples to be found in the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-Value result is the measure of how 'unusual' the result is. If a P-Value is small, it means that one of the test samples couldnt possibly be compared correctly to the other (or rather mixed up with them). If the p-value is large it means that the result isnt that 'unusual' and so one might conclude that the two samples could be mixed up. In other words, the p-value tells us if the data we have observed is suprising to see assuming a certain assumption (that it is a fair test/dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the two values are so drastically spread apart from each other (statistic reult being large and p-value being small) it is very likely that the means of the two samples are significantly different - this test is evidence that there is a significant difference between the Male and Female Gentoo penguin's body mass."
